  - no major bugs known

  - need to look at the change to mdport.c which threw 
error on compile:

=====
 mdport.c:273:15: error: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type ‘TERMINAL {aka struct term}’
    if (cur_term->type.Strings == NULL)
                ^~
 Makefile:130: recipe for target 'mdport.o' failed
=====

  a temporary fix was suggested by Sven Joachim on the
curses bug mailing list:

  which worked, but when i or someone else gets back
to this code it would be nice to change it so that the
define isn't needed.
